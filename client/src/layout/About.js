				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>
					The mission of Bandit is to provide qualified resources for low
					voltage and IT Partners in areas where internal service technicians
					are unavailable or nonexistent to assist customers. With the continual
					commoditization of product, service levels are even more imperative to
					provide value and lower attrition in the “on demand” world. The Bandit
					network allows Partners to utilize certified labor 24/7 and maintain
					the current service rate card structure. Furthermore, it provides the
					flexibility to comply with shorter response times that are being
					demanded by today’s market. Exceptional service is far too rare and
					Bandit is out to solve this with prompt exceptional service. Anytime.
					Anywhere.
