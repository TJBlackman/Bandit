						<h3>Commitment</h3>
						<p>
							Our commitment to providing the best team members as an extension
							of your business is a great honor. We understand the trust
							required to allow us to interact with your customer and our
							promise is to meet that expectation. Everytime.
						</p>

						<h3>Accountability</h3>
						<p>
							Follow-through with a service call/project is at the core of every
							technician that has gone through the Bandit vetting process.
							Technicians are responsible for keeping up to date on the industry
							standards and best practices to ensure the safety of the client
							and ultimate satisfaction upon completion. When a technician
							accepts a job, it is their responsibility to see it through.
						</p>

						<h3>Honesty</h3>
						<p>
							Having a team with integrity and openness builds a foundation of
							trust that subcontractors do not always achieve. Challenges can
							and do happen within a call, thus effective communication to
							reassure and provide options in our top priority... resolution.
						</p>
					</div>

						<h3>Expertise</h3>
						<p>
							The Bandit team Tiers allow a Partner to choose which level of
							expertise is needed on a call. Some situations are more critical
							than others, so having the flexibility to reduce cost for the
							customer for a quick resolution can help tremendously.
							Certifications, licensing documentation and work-related history
							is also required to advance in Tiers. So, we can guarantee
							Partners are being represented as well as, if not better, than a
							W2 employee.
						</p>

					<div className="row">
						<img src="/images/expert.png" alt="" />
						<h3>Ownership</h3>
						<p>
							Joining the Bandit team requires that extreme ownership be part of
							your DNA. If we accept a job, itâ€™s guaranteed to be resolved. Our
							staff has an extensive history in security, making our collective
							knowledge among the top. In addition, our dedication to putting
							your customer first is second to none. When a project is accepted,
							our goal is to create a unified front as problem solvers willing
							to do whatever it takes.
